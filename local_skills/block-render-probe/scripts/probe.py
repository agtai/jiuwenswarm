"""Print one hardcoded Slack-mrkdwn fixture, selected by ``--type``.

Every fixture below is a fixed string (or built from a fixed, non-random range
of numbers) chosen to land on one side or the other of a specific rule in the
Slack rich-block renderer: the row count that turns a ``table`` into a
``data_table``, the column that must sort as numbers, the fence language that
decides whether a code block is drawn or shown, the block types a hand-written
fence may carry, the separate refusal of anything a reader could click, and the
two-chart ceiling a message may not cross locally. Nothing here is generated
from live data, and the script takes no input beyond the selector -- no network,
no state file, no scratch directory.

The fence vocabulary the negative cases turn on, in full::

    ```mermaid      drawn as a diagram
    ```vega-lite    drawn as a chart, however this connector can draw it
    ```blockkit     drawn as the Block Kit blocks its JSON describes
    ```slack-raw    never drawn; shown as the source it holds
    ```             an unnamed fence, likewise never drawn

Charts reach Slack from four of those -- a mermaid ``pie``, a mermaid
``xychart-beta``, a ``vega-lite`` spec, and hand-written ``blockkit`` -- and
each of the four has a fixture here. Every parser declines a shape it does not
recognise rather than guessing at it, so two fixtures below carry a shape that
must decline and be shown as source.

Usage::

    probe.py --type <kind>

Print the available kinds and exit non-zero when ``--type`` is missing or
unrecognised, so a caller who mistypes one is not left guessing.
